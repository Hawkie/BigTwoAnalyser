# BigTwoAnalyser
Python project to simulate various odds for the card game Big Two: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two

# Probabilities 
The calculations created so far are the probabilities of receiving the poker combinations from a starting hand of thirteen. To do this, run the script simulation.py.

After 1000000 simulations
### Pair=0.999899
### Triple=0.48988
### FourOfAKind=0.034036
### Straight=0.580586
### Flush=0.648207
### StraightFlush=0.034254

# Project Goal
The aim of the project is to calculate and display probabilities of winning against 1,2 or 3 opponents with a given hand and how best to play each hand.
